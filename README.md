yeah so this is that but for your pc.\
It will be very sensible with how it does everything do not worry.


I am aware the way I have organised the code is bizzare however I do not feel any other way of organising it provides better performance or clarity when reading/writing it.\ A brief description on how it is organised:
- Each solution is in it's own folder with the tests to be in the same folder with them
- Each solution is it's own self running project with no dependency on each other
